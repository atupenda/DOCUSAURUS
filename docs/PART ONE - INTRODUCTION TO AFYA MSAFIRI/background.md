## Background

The **Afyamsafiri** is a web-based system used by the Ministry of Health to undertake traveler surveillance at points of entry in Tanzania mainland. The system aims to assist early detection and response to Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC) to align with International Health Regulationsâ€™ core capacities. The system is used by both travelers and Port Health Authorities and has been linked with the Government Electronic Payment Gateway (GePG) to support online payment. Furthermore, the system will be used to implement other port health core functions electronically.

Through this system, travelers will be required to provide travel information, travel history, and health information 24 hours before arrival, while domestic travelers will be required to provide the same information 24 hours before travel. The information provided will help Port Health Officers prepare for screening and other logistical arrangements for the management of ill travelers. The Afyamsafiri System has been categorized into Departure, Arrival, and Yellow Fever.
